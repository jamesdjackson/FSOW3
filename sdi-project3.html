<p>My theme is Yoshitoshi's 100 Ghosts of China series of Japanese woodblock prints produced during the Golden Age of Ukiyo-e.</p>
<p>It is another of my favorite works of art and had a numeric basis that lent itself to the exercises.</p>
<p>It was my intent to revisit what I did wrong and correct it as well as improve on existing work.  The course is iterative and cumulative in nature,
    so it seemed logical to approach the work in the same manner.  Below is the print "Shobu" from the series.</p>
